In this post, we are goint to use Docker to create an image of a Spring Boot application and run it in a container. 

**1. create a Spring Boot application**
Let's generate a Spring Boot application with a standard maven plugin that includes Spring Web dependency.

**2. create a rest controller**
Basically, I added a rest controller to prove that the application is working.

**3. add Dockerfile to the project**
I created a file called Dockerfile to the root directory without extension and put following 3 lines into it.
```bash
FROM openjdk:17-alpine
COPY /target/*.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","app.jar"]
```

**4. add maven plugin as a plugin**
At this point, I need a maven plugin. Check the pom.xml file. You have to append it, if there is no such plugin.
```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

**5. define a bitbucket-pipelines(optional)**
I'm not going to talk about this right now because I'll explain it in detail in the future. You don't have to do this step right now.

**6. build the project**
If the maven plugin is available for you to use in the terminal, run the "mvn install" command to provide your project built. You are going to see that the target package and jar files in it are created.

**7. execute java jar command**
```bash
java -jar target/docker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
Eventually, the project is up and running, and when I send a request from the browser, I expect to see "Hello World Docker" on the screen. 

So far, our application has worked flawlessly, but not in any docker container. I guess everything we've done so far is clear, understandable, and the way we always do.

The commands we are going to write from now on will make the project run on a docker container.

You can use the commands below to check containers and images running on Docker.
```bash
docker ps -a
docker images
docker rmi a67aecce36a5
```
**8. run docker commands for containerization**

```bash
docker build -t docker-example-service .
docker run -p 8085:8085 --name docker-example-service -d docker-example-service

# to communicate with the remote database
docker run -p 8085:8085 -e PORT=8085 -e POSTGRESQL_HOST=192.168.X.X -e POSTGRESQL_PORT=5432 -e POSTGRESQL_DB_NAME=exampleDb -e POSTGRESQL_USER=postgres -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=postgres --name docker-example-service -d docker-example-service

docker ps -a
docker logs -f 904957ee3ae2
```
üëå And Spring Boot application is running on the Docker container as expected. üòä üéâ üëè
